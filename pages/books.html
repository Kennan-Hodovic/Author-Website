                The Centuries War has brought conflict and violence to the world for as long as people can remember, entrapping the kingdoms of Arcadia and Adamance 
                into endless turmoil. Even young apprentices, not even fully adults, must leave their homes to go fight. That is exactly the case for Alex, Leo, and 
                Cynthia, three vivacious teenagers from different backgrounds who are being placed under the guidance of one Guardian to train with and prepare for 
                a new offensive in the war. Doubts of their own abilities, fear of injustice, and a burning desire for revenge all hang around them, but they must put 
                aside their worries to work together and become the team that leads Arcadia to victory. If only it were so simple.
                <br><br>
                Guardians, bearers of Divine Essence inherited from the Gods and wielders of ancient elemental power imbued into their mythical chromatic swords, 
                are the legendary warriors who stand at the spear tip of battle and defend their forces from enemy fire. It’s what they’re training to become, 
                but many Guardians much more powerful than them have tried and failed to end the war, all brought to heel by the Ash Dancer. Appearing out of 
                nowhere and awakening a new elemental ability never seen before, Mara Sov has laid waste to Arcadia’s forces with fiery vengeance and has turned 
                the tide of war in favor of Adamance. She is enemy number one and there doesn’t seem to be anyone capable of stopping her.
                <br><br>
                Caught up in the machinations of war, Alex, Leo, and Cynthia must travel with their master to the frontlines and use their very limited training to 
                start achieving the impossible. All paths that lead to war though lead to Mara Sov and her exploding ash, and their encounter will require everything 
                they know and more just to have a chance at survival. Thunder will shake the world, flames will burn everything in their path, even innocents, and 
                dark winds will carry secrets that can change everything. In the face of despair and fear, what comes out will determine who wins the Centuries War.

                    Six months have passed since the fall of Jora and Mara Sov's defection to Arcadia. Before, Arcadia was slowly pushing back against Adamance's 
                    dominance in the Centuries War, but now the tides have turned. With the Ash Dancer at their helm, Arcadia is on Adamance's doorstep and 
                    pushing through. The end of the Centuries War is approaching, but the flames keeping it alive will not die so easily.
                    <br><br>
                    Trained by their masters, Alex, Leo, and Cynthia are stronger than ever and are becoming recognized for their feats by their peers. As strong as 
                    they are though, the path before them is more fraught with danger than ever before. Adamance's hidden Guardian council, the ones actually ruling 
                    the kingdom, are stepping out from the shadows. To defeat them will require strength that none of them have alone, but even together, the cost 
                    may be too great.
                    <br><br>
                    What happens next will lay the foundation for the end of this eternal conflict, but the greatest threats may not appear to be what they are.
                    Dormant for as long as people can remember, the Kingdom of Luxe is awakening and is ready to seek vengeance.
