            As you can no doubt infer from the title, my website is finished!
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I wrote the last blog post just over a month ago, finishing everything didn't take the whole month. I mainly was working on it on the side after 
            I came home from work or on the weekends. That work mainly consisted of some reformatting, setting up my socials, and learning how to make the website
            compatible with displays of various sizes, like a person's phone. I also had to learn how to publish the website using GitHub Pages, which was a whole
            ordeal in and of itself, mainly on the Squarespace side. 
        </p>
        <p>
            GitHub Pages can host your website for free so long as your website is completely static, meaning it can't have things like an online store or other
            features that users dynamically interact with. A static website suits my needs perfectly for now so I was happy to take advantage of the free hosting.
            In the future, I might transfer away from GitHub Pages should I ever need dynamic content or get to the point where I need it, but it shouldn't be any
            time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            GitHub Pages will also give you a free domain name that you can use with your website and encrypt with https. It will include your GitHub username and
            repository name, along with the .github.io extension at the end. For my case, I think it would have been <em>www.kennan-hodovic/Author-Website.github.io.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I briefly considered the idea keeping the default name since that would have kept everything completely free but I felt it was a bit of a mouthful. So,
            I started to look for custom domain names were availble that had my name in them. As luck would have it, I found <em>www.kennanhodovic.com</em> was still
            untaken and felt that I should sieze this opportunity while I still could. For transparency, purchasing the domain name from Squarespace cost me $12. It
            will be mine for the year and then I will have to renew the name for $20 every following year. After some finagling, I managed to connect my domain name
            to GitHub Pages and the website went live.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this project finished, my plan is to start querying again and begin working on the second draft for Tears of Thunder. That revision will take a
            little more work than what it did for the first book, but I'm excited to get back into writing again. Once that is finished, book three will be written
            next. I'm still brainstorming the name but I have a few ideas. Keep an eye out for that announcement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mentioned last time the next blog post would either be a book review or a discussion about my book, and that will definitely be true this time. My plan
            is to have that published sometime next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's all I have for now. It took some time but we're cooking with butter now. Thanks for stopping by.
