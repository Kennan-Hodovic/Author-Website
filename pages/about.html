                Kennan Hodovic was born in May 2001 in Houston, Texas and spent most of his time growing up reading books. Known as the one kid in school who carried 
                <i>tomes</i> in his bag, he loved reading epic fantasy series and was never daunted by the size of books or how many in a series there were. It wasn't 
                until Freshman year of college that he learned he had a passion for writing and started creating stories of his own that he wrote on the side while 
                studying aerospace engineering at Texas A&M University. The stories he imagined kept getting longer and longer until eventually he had the plans for 
                his own epic fantasy series. The first book in that series, <b><i>Sins of Ash</i></b>, was written Senior year in 2023 and its sequel,
                <b><i>Tears of Thunder</i></b>, in 2024. Now he is working on publishing his debut novel and hopes to share these books with the world soon.
