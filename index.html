                I like to write sci-fi fantasy books with epic worldbuilding and complex characters. My inspirations are many, but they all coalesce together into
                stories that I hope will tug at people's hearts and make them excited to keep reading. Thanks for stopping by!
                <br><br>
                As of writing this, I am an unpublished author who is actively querying for agents to represent my debut novel <b><i>Sins of Ash</i></b>. This is a story
                about friendship, betrayal, overcoming one's fears, and finding the courage to keep moving forward in a world that seems determined to keep you down.
                It is the first of a YA/New Adult fantasy epic titled <b><i>Dancing Gods</i></b> and is a great fit for fans of anime, high-stakes action, and endearing
                characters. You can read more about it, including some sample chapters, <a href="pages/books.html">here!</a>
                <br><br>
                There are few things in life that I find more enjoyable than a story that manages to immerse me in the world and characters and make me excited to
                talk to others about. As inferred by the name, storytelling is about connecting with others and finding shared passions and excitement through
                entertainment. It can bridge the gap between people's hearts and leave them fuller because of it. That is my hope and goal with these books. I hope you
                enjoy them.
